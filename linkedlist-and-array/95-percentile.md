Given a list of integers representing the lengths of urls, find the 95 percentile of all lengths (`95%` of the urls have lengths `<=` returned length).

**Assumptions**

The maximum length of valid url is 4096

The list is not null and is not empty and does not contain null

**Examples:**

    95 percentile of all lengths is 95.
